# Bro_Code_Python_Full_Course
bro code talks. i write. sometimes i understand. these are those... notes? sure. more like a stream of consciousness while i pretend to learn python. might be useful, might not. includes code snippets, explanations (kinda), and probably a bunch of unnecessary comments. read at your own risk. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥  p.s. if somethingâ€™s wrong, no itâ€™s not.
