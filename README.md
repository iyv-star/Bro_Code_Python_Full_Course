# 🐍 Bro Code Python Notes - aka my brain dump  
bro code talks. i write. sometimes i understand. these are those... notes? sure. more like a stream of consciousness while i pretend to learn python. might be useful, might not. includes code snippets, explanations (kinda), and probably a bunch of unnecessary comments. read at your own risk. 🚀🔥  p.s. if something’s wrong, no it’s not.

**welcome.** these are my python notes from bro code’s course. they are unorganized. they are messy. but they exist, and that’s what matters. 

## 🚀 what’s inside?  
✅ **code snippets** – mostly functional, occasionally cursed  
✅ **explanations** – some useful, some just me talking to myself  
✅ **random formatting** – because plain text is boring  

## ⚠️ what’s NOT inside?  
❌ structure (lol what’s that?)  
❌ proper documentation (good luck)  
❌ my patience for debugging  

## 📂 how to use this repo  
1. **clone it** (or don’t. i’m not your boss.)

2. **go through the files** – if you can understand them, congrats.  
3. **run the code** – but don’t blame me if something breaks.
